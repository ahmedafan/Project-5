Data Cleaning: Processed data to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure data accuracy.
Data Structuring: Organized data into structured tables suitable for pivot table analysis.

Tools and Techniques

Excel Pivot Tables: Used pivot tables to dynamically summarize and analyze sales data.
Pivot Charts: Created pivot charts for visual representation of data.
Slicers and Filters: Implemented slicers and filters to enable interactive data exploration.

Analysis and Visualization

Sales by Country: Created a pivot table to summarize total sales by country, visualized with a corresponding pivot chart to highlight regional sales performance.
Sales by Order Date: Analyzed sales trends over time by summarizing sales by order date, and visualized using line charts to show monthly and yearly sales trends.
Total Sales: Aggregated total sales data to provide an overall view of sales performance.
Top 5 Customers: Identified and visualized the top 5 customers based on total sales, highlighting key customers driving revenue.
Roast Type: Analyzed sales by coffee roast type (e.g., light, medium, dark) to identify popular products.
Coffee Size: Examined sales data by coffee size (e.g., small, medium, large) to understand customer preferences.
Loyalty Card Usage: Tracked and visualized sales attributed to loyalty card holders, providing insights into customer loyalty and repeat purchases.

Key Features

Interactive Dashboard: Developed an interactive dashboard with slicers for country, order date, roast type, and coffee size to allow users to filter and drill down into specific data segments.
Dynamic Updates: Ensured the dashboard updates automatically with new data entries, maintaining real-time relevance.
Visual Representation: Utilized bar charts, line charts, and pie charts to present data in a clear and visually appealing manner.
